### Project 6 - Escaping the Maze
***
## Instructions
Lost in a maze [Reborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json "Reborg's World")

Reeborg was exploring a dark maze and the battery in its flashlight ran out.

Write a program using an if/elif/else statement so Reeborg can find the exit. 
The secret is to have Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze, turning right if it can, going straight ahead if it canâ€™t turn right, or turning left as a last resort.

The functions ```move()``` and ```turn_left()```.
Either the test ````front_is_clear()``` or ```wall_in_front```(), ```right_is_clear()``` or ```wall_on_right()```, and ```at_goal()```.
How to use a ```while``` loop and ```if/elif/else``` statements.
It might be useful to know how to use the negation of a test (not in Python).

A robot located at (x, y) = (2, 4) carries no objects.

### Goal
The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = (6, 4)
